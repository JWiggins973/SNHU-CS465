# SNHU-CS465
Contains my final project for the term( Travel website with Mean Stack application)

## Functionality and Purpose
For this project, I added MEAN stack functionality to a static webpage and built a single-page application (SPA). Users of the static HTML/Handlebars frontend can view data provided by the backend, while users of the Angular SPA can both view and manage data dynamically. Angular handles frontend interactions, MongoDB stores the data, and Node.js/Express manage backend operations.

## Journal 📝

### **Architecture**

* Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
* Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

### **Functionality**

* How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
* Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

### **Testing**

* Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

### **Reflection**

* How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
